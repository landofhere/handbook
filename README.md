# Our Handbook

What you are reading is was being written for a company of one. Perhaps you are number two or even the three-hundred and thirty-seventh. What really matters is that I hope you've found yourself joining something may no longer just be a dream or experiment, but really has become a way for us to nurture together, here.

This handbook is another small step in the Land of Here's journey to make the world a better place — the workplace is a great area to start in. It's built or rather converted, with much gratitude to Clef via Josephine. They too are companies built on value-driven culture and working to break down the exclusionary barriers and hidden biases inherent in any company that grows beyond one. So let us continue their work and innovation in creating places where people can together work, play and live in a nurturing and supportive reality.

This repository contains all of the policies that we use at Land of Here. It was forked from Josephin's flavor of the Clef handbook, and we will cultivate our own as we grow.

Feel free to fork this repository and use any or all of these policies, and to modify them in whatever way makes sense for your company. We hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from our research and make their own policies more inclusive.

All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. We’ve gotten several different perspectives to help arrive at these policies, but we are certainly missing many more and making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

If these policies sound like a place where you want to work, check out our jobs postings at [landofhere.com/about](https://landofhere.com/about).
