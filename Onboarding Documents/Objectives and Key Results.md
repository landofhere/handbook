#Objectives and Key Results

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a method for defining and keeping track of goals and their outcomes. They organize our goals by breaking them into high-level aspirations (objectives) and the measurable results that determine whether or not we’ve reached them (key results). Typically, OKRs are set at the company and at individual level to help everyone see how their personal goals align with the company goals, and also see how other people in the organization are working for the same outcomes from a different perspective.

When we first tried setting OKRs for Q1 2016, we found that the founding team's collaborative workstyle made individual OKRs very difficult to set. Members of each team frequently cross-delegate and contribute to initiatives in near-equal capacities depending on what is the most effective that day or week. Thus we've decided to set Josephine OKRs at company and team levels this quarter, rather than company and individual levels. The idea is that currently every one on our team can work on almost everything that falls within their team OKRs, so granular delegation of projects and tasks can happen on a shorter timeline, allowing for team optimized efficacy, rather than strict specialization. 

While we're proud that communication within the founding team currently allows for this type of work fluidity, we realize that it is a luxury we will outgrow as soon as we grow the team and need more objective and individualized goal setting. Our plan is to re-evaluate the need for individual OKR setting for Q2 of 2016. 

## Examples

Objectives are the high level achievements you are shooting for, like:

* Increase cook satisfaction

* Improve cook vetting and onboarding process

* Increase customer cook cross-pollination

* Tell the story of our community to a broader audience

* Help cooks market to their audiences more easily

* Bring Josephine to new strategic markets


Key results are the measurable outcomes that define success for the objectives. **Key results must be measurable on a scale from 0-10**, so for the second example objective, the results might be:

* Review onboarding process for 10 most recently onboarded cooks and identify steps that took the longest amount of time to complete on average (% completion)

* Write documentation and create tools for 3 biggest improvement opportunities within the vetting and onboarding process by July 15 (-2 points for each day late)

* Onboard 8 new cooks using improved vetting and onboarding practices by Sept 31 (% complete)

* Reduce average time from application recieved to first meal by 25%, starting at 16 days (% completion)

## Setting OKRs

Every team at Josephine sets their OKRs quarterly, writing them in the first week of the quarter and then evaluating them in the last week. At a startup it’s easy to focus on the immediate problems, but by setting our goals quarterly we ensure that everyone spends some time thinking about the challenges at least 3 months out.

Each team should set 3 to 5 objectives for the quarter, and each objective should have a maximum of 4 key results. Each objective also has a Description explaining what it means and an Alignment that explains how it aligns with company-wide goals. Each key result should explain how it will be scored at the end of the quarter.

## Tracking OKRs

Every team's OKRs will be compiled and kept in a Google Spreadsheet in the OKRs Folder. Within the spreadsheet, there should be a new sheet for each new quarter.

More specific units of work revolving around Key Results should be organized in team-specific Trello Boards (or Zenhub) that are accessible to the entire company. This is where individual task owners can be assigned and tasks can be re-prioritized.

OKRS should be talked about every two weeks to consider how each objective is progressing, places where help may be necessary, and how well they reflect current objectives.

## Scoring and Evaluating OKRs

OKRs are scored at the end of the quarter, with a score generated for each Key Result. The average of the key results give a score for each Objective, and the average scores of the Objectives gives an overall score for the quarter.

A key result can be scored in any way that makes sense for the result, but there are a few common ways to score a Key Result:

* **% completion** -- if the goal is to do some number of actions, or achieve some number of results (post 3 blog posts or get 300 views), then the Key Result can be scored according to the % that were completed. Posting 2 results out of 3 would earn a score of ⅔ x 10 (because 10 is the total possible number of points) or a 6.7.

* **Due date** -- if a resource should be delivered on a given day, then a fixed number of points can be docked based on how many days late the resource is finished. The penalty should be set with the key result and should vary depending on how time-sensitive the result is. For instance, if my coworker needs me to finish something on time so that they can use it, then there should be a heavy penalty for being late. If the penalty for an item is -2 points per day, then finishing it 3 days late gives a score of 4.

* **Deviation** -- if you are trying to hit a precise target, and do not want to go above or below it, then the score can be based on how far off you were.

The scoring method should be included with each key result. If two people independently evaluated your OKRs at the same time, they should be sure to get the same scores because the criteria for evaluation should be unambiguous.

OKRs should never be used in evaluating employee performance, and should be ambitious. An average score of 7 is ideal, and no one should ever get to a full 10. If they do, their goals were set too low.
