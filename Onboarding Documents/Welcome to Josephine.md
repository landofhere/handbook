# Welcome to Land of Here

Hey! Welcome to the Land of Here team, we’re so excited to have you with us. We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will give you an idea of what to expect on your first day in the office. 

At Land of Here, we’re trying to build a mission and values-driven organization, so you’ll find that a lot of our policies differ from the norm at other companies. If you have any questions about why we do things a certain way, or have a suggestion about how we can do anything better, please let us know (or just write comments in the documents -- you should already have comment access to everything in the Land of Here handbook!).

## Arrival Logistics

Your first day is a chance to get introduced to everyone you're working with and start setting things up the way you like them. 

You should bring your computer and charger, or have let us know that you intend to use a Land of Here computer setup. 

Please arrive by 10a to our office in Oakstop: 1721 Broadway #202, Oakland, CA 94612 

## Your First Day Schedule

* 11-11:45a— State of Land of Here business update 
* Noon-12:45p— Lunch with your team

If you have any food preferences or restrictions that we should consider, let us know!


## Team Social Activity

New team members are always a reason for celebration! We'd love to do one of the activites below as a team outside of the office sometime during your first week: 

* We can all go visit a Land of Here meal
* We can go out for a drink or dessert nearby together
* We can all go to dinner somewhere nearby

The first day can be intense, so we totally get it if you’re feeling drained and would rather go home to get ready for day number two. Just let us know when and which option you'd prefer. We just want to celebrate with you however you feel comfortable!


## First Week To-Dos

- [Set up your computer](https://github.com/landofhere/wiki/blob/master/New%20Employee%20Setup/For%20Employees/Setting%20Up%20Your%20Computer.md) (follow all the instructions here!)
- Read [Employee Handbook] (https://github.com/landofhere/handbook)

## The Land of Here Team and Office

You'll get a sense for our team culture and workstyle organically, but on your first day we'll make an effort to at least preview each team's focus and current projects. Although we have three teams within Land of Here (Cook Ops, Biz Ops, and Product), we are small enough that most major projects still touch every team. When we set our individual goals, we all think directly about how they contribute to the overall company goals. You’ll get to work with everyone at Land of Here in some capacity, and dip your fingers into all different kinds of thinking.

We're so excited to have you join our family and contribute to our mission. Please don't be shy if you have any questions or comments, especially as we all go through this process of getting to know new people and environments.
