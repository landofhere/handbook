# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Land of Here, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/landofhere/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), Land of Here offers unlimited paid vacation with a 3 week (15 day) suggested minimum every year. We expect most employees will take between 15 and 20 paid vacation days each year.  Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

Sick leave, paid time off and remote work needs should also be shared with teams as far in advance as possible. Each will be tracked seperately and expectations will be defined more specifically going forward.  

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with their manager about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.
