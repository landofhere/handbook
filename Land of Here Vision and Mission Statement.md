# Vision & Mission Statement

Our Vision Statement is the big picture of *Land of Here*. What we see up ahead and where we want to go. Our Mission Statement is the _What_ and _How_ of getting there.

Normally, the Vision is kept internally and held tightly in companies. At *Land of Here*, our Vision is built on creating the future together internally and externally of the company. Also, if others were to head in the same direction, we don't think it'd be such a bad thing. To read about the refined focus of our Vision & Mission Statements, see our [Values](https://github.com/landofhere/handbook/blob/master/Land of Here%20Values.md).

Our Vision:
# Nurturing together, here

Our mission at Land of Here:

# We create tools for local collaboration that nurture community prosperity.
