# Sourcing Candidates

Our ability to serve the Land of Here community hinges on our ability to be representative of it - not just as a company, but as individuals with unique perspectives. We need to be thoughtful about the ways we attract candidates and the biases that result from each of those channels so that candidates can get behind our mission while increasing our empathetic capacity as a group.

## Organization
For every position open at Land of Here, there should be one founding team member who is in charge of the recruiting efforts for that position (role owner). This starts with writing the job description and publishing it on [landofhere.com](http://landofhere.com/jobs), but also means proactively searching for people who might be a good fit, looking for pools of candidates that we can recruit from, and asking friends for introductions to promising candidates.

Additionally, every candidate that moves through the hiring pipeline should have a candidate lead. The candidate lead for referrals and outbound recruiting should be the team member closest to the candidate. Inbound applications should default to the role owner as the candidate lead, but can be delegated to other members of the team.

Every inbound application should receive a response from the Land of Here team within 1 week so that they feel heard and like they were able to reach us personally. It's important for us to do our best to treat all of our candidates and applicants with respect and transparency, _especially_ when things get busy and applications are pouring in. Unfortunately, we will have to turn away many candidates that are genuinely excited about our mission and are entirely qualified to serve our community - there are more people deserving of roles at Land of Here than there are roles available. Thus, we should work to keep our own luck, privilege, and opportunities in mind when interacting with folks who want to join our team.

## Referrals

Referrals from people who already work at Land of Here are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful at Land of Here. Land of Here employees understand Land of Here’s needs and what it’s like to work at Land of Here, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

In order to get good referrals, everyone needs to know which positions are open, know how to start the recruiting process, have time to search their network, and feel aligned with the company incentives. Open positions should be posted on [landofhere.com](landofhere.com/jobs) and also in the #hiring channel so that everyone sees who we’re trying to hire. We’ll host a company lunch with food on the second Tuesday of every month where we talk about which positions are open and go through everyone’s online networks looking for and thinking about candidates. Employees will do initial outreach to interesting connections, which will give us a good space to talk about how we start the recruiting process.

**The danger with referrals is that we are most likely to refer candidates who are like us, which can result in a homogenous team instead of the diverse one we want to create.** We should emphasize diversity as a priority in our referral lunches and also search the local networks we are involved in. We should also continue to look for other ways to offset this bias on an organizational level.

## Outbound Recruiting

It is critical that we find talent pools of diverse candidates to pull from, and that our outbound recruiting intentionally target underrepresented groups. If we are recruiting from universities, we need to be careful about which schools we draw from. If we are pulling people from other companies, it’s important that we are thoughtful about the location and industry biases of those companies. Land of Here works with and supports many local and national organizations that focus on more equitable food and tech industries, including Oakland Food Policy Council, Kapor Capital, Raise the Root Collctive, Mandela Cooperative, City Slicker Farms, Acta Non Verba, The Sustainable Economies Law Center, and The Town Kitchen. Our work with these communities should help us find pools of candidates to recruit from.

## Inbound Applications

All of our job openings and descriptions will be posted on [landofhere.com](http://landofhere.com/jobs), and some will be posted on other sites where we can advertise our open positions. Careful thought should be given to where we post job openings, as traditional boards have homogeneous audiences. We will also have people reading about Land of Here through our blog and social media, interest generated from within our cook community, and a broad audience hearing about Land of Here through news or word of mouth.

Inbound applications give us the highest number of candidates that are outside of our personal networks, but also have the lowest initial filter because no one at Land of Here is making any judgment about the candidate before they enter our pipeline. However, an inbound application is a strong signal that the candidates believes in what we’re doing at Land of Here. This means that a smaller percentage will progress through our interview funnel, but that we still need to treat these candidates with respect.
