# Interview Process

Every candidate should go through at least three interviews that help us find the right person for the job.

# Screening

Before they are interviewed, the candidate should show some relevant work that will help give us an initial screen and something to talk about in the first coffee interview. This work should be role specific, so it can be code, a writing sample, a social media account, or even organizational docs. 

They should also get a blurb about Land of Here, the position, and our values so that they can self-screen if our culture doesn’t match the kind of company they want to work for. **Values in particular should be emphasized here so that they understand how important they are to the Land of Here team and make sure they align.**

# Informal/Coffee — 45 Minutes

A resume or online profile can tell us a lot about what a candidate has done, but the first thing we need to find out is what they want to do next, and whether that matches what we’re looking for at Land of Here. This interview can happen over the phone, Skype, in the office, or out at a coffee shop.

The idea is to spend 45 minutes getting to know the candidate and letting them ask questions about Land of Here and the position. This has screened about 80% of candidates so far, which seems about right. It should be pretty transparent if the candidate’s experience or interests are misaligned for the job. Interview formats may vary, but some information spanning three categories should be gained:

 1. Can the candidate do the job? (work experience, portfolio, high level skills assessment)
 2. Will the candidate want to do the job? (motivations, work place priorities)
 3. Would we want to spend a lot of time with the candidate? (communication, values, collaboration style)

This interview should also focus on selling Land of Here and recruiting promising candidates, as this is their first real contact with Land of Here and their desire to work here will be formed in this meeting.

# Skills Assessment — 2 Hours

The skills assessment is a chance to dive into the candidate’s ability at the job they’re interviewing for. The lead on this hire should prepare two exercises, one which goes into high level thinking for the position and the other which focuses on more low level implementation.

The last 30 minutes should be used for questions and answers from both sides. This interview should filter out 50-70% of candidates (of the remaining 20%), and by the end of it, the lead interviewer should have an opinion on whether or not the candidate is the right person for the job.

# Team Fit — Full Day

Finally, the candidate should come in for a whole day of talking to and working with the team. In the morning they'll drill into a much more challenging problem than they had to deal with in their technical interview. We want to get a sense for how candidates handle something out of their comfort zone, how they ask for help, etc. It’s also important that candidates feel like they’ve earned their offer by the time they get it, so this part of the process should be hard!

After the morning exercises, candidates go out to lunch with the team before coming back to the office for one on ones with everyone. As we get a little bigger, this might need to be one on twos to fit conversations into a reasonable amount of time.
