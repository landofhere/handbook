# Land of Here Core Values

At Land of Here, our Mission would be a magnifying glass that projected the light of our Vision in a more specific direction. Our Values make up the lens of that magnifying glass and guide how our Vision is distilled upon each and every interaction and touchpoint, internally and externally. Our Values are formed by a single word that notably, aligns with our Vision. A Value statement and explanation accompanies each Value word to clarify our intentions.

##Here: Lively, explorative, kindly engagement with our present where.

A wide-awake, deeply rooted presence  in one's immediate environment â€” community that includes not only human  ties but also a celebration of all that exists and grows and makes up  the experience of being alive somewhere.

##Collaborative: Exploring and tending our here in company of friends.

Learning to be in this together, with our ideas  and strengths meshing to propel us as a community toward a prosperous and conscientious way of life here.

##Conscientious: To live well and generously.

Devotion to here exemplified in a desire to sustain as well as be sustained and endurance in doing the best we can in even the smallest ways if it will move us in a direction of kindly use.
